# Flappy-Bird

So I tried to make the flappy bird game using only HTML5 and Javascript. You can change the difficulty 
by messing around the variables in the js file. The logic is quite simple and can be easily understood.
The page is reloaded once you lose the game so that you can play without any hindrance.

### Controls

You can press any key on the keyboard to move the bird up.
Holding the key will cause the bird to move upwards with greater speed.

Note: Only vanilla javascript is used (No Frameworks).
